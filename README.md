# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script `image-classification-deep-learning.py` for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using deep learning techniques. The script demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to categorize images into one of the ten classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for plotting images and accuracy graphs)

## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Script

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `image-classification-deep-learning.py`.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python image-classification-deep-learning.py
```

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
